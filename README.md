# Coding Fundamentals Quiz

## Purpose
This coding fundamentals quiz was created to test your basic knowledge on the syntax and structure of HTML, CSS and Javascript. Every time you start the quiz, you are given a time limit that counts down from 75, and if you get a question incorrect, 15 seconds is taken off of the time clock. If the time clock reaches zero or you have gotten through all of the questions, you will be brought to the finishing screen where you are shown your score and given the chance to enter your name and save your score. You are then able to see the list of highscores and then choose if you want to clear the score list, or restart the quiz to try again.
